## Developing

You should first make sure you have:
- Java installed and in your PATH
- Android SDK command-line tools installed

You can then build the app normally from Android Studio or from CLI by running:

```sh
# Debug build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# or release build
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The desktop-app can be build with:


```sh
./gradlew jar

```

## Todo:

- Option to switch between usb-detection modes
- file support
- folder/filepicker selector popup
- in-app-decryption of files
